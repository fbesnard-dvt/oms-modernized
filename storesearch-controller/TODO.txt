TODO post code-copy
===================
This file contains a list of to-do items to be reviewed and addressed based on code-copy execution.

General Steps
=============
- Make sure you are using the correct Java JDK version
- Build and install the common library first
- Use the spotless plugin to remove unnecessary imports (mvn spotless:apply or gradle spotlessApply depending on your build system)
- Check to see if constant declarations are missing (static final fields that may have been optimized out by the compiler)
- Check to see if auto-refactored classes (aka partial classes) are missing implementations and create the necessaery stubs
